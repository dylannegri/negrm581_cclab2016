        "review": "Clearly one of the worst restaurants in the country, not because of their food or service but rather their misleading/fradulent business practices.  A tell-tale sign that something is amiss here is the multiple names (aliases) for the place of business.  The advertising leader that we were handed as we were walking down Ocean Drive said the restaurant is called \"The Pershing\".  The bill I signed said the restaurant is called the \"Chef Vincent Restaurant\".  Neither of these places can be found on Yelp though.  Carefully searching for the same physical address, I have came to learn that the place is known as the \"Colony Cafe\".  Reading the other reviews, I see the restaurant has other aliases as well.  One clear reason for all of the different names is to escape the 1.5 star average that this place is enjoying on Yelp.  The average is surprisingly high though, because this place is a blatant RIPOFF like I have never seen before.  For lunch, their advertising leader offers a number of specials for $9.50 and also promises 2 for 1 happy hour drinks.  Simple enough, I assumed.  I opted for a Cuban sandwich which really was $9.50.  For the drinks, I asked if I could have a rum and coke instead of one of the cocktails, and my girlfriend asked if she could have a virgin (nonalcoholic) daiquiri.  Both requests were honored, and we were shortly presented with two gigantic glasses filled with our drinks.  The sandwich is absolutely terrible and not in the least authentic.  How can they serve such a lousy Cuban sandwich in the heart of Miami?  The bread was toasted and hot, while at the same time the pork lunch meat inside was very cold; I can only assume it came directly from the refrigerator.  There was no Bolo ham, or any ham for that matter.  There was raw tomato and lettuce though which I have never seen before on a Cuban sandwich.  Just lousy and even at $9.50 it cost about twice as much as an amazing Cuban sandwich I had in Little Havana just days prior.   Beyond the terrible sandwich, my serious gripe is with the drinks.  Our two for one drinks, one of which was non-alcoholic, cost us $27.  Really, a rum and coke and a virgin cocktail normally costs $54 for lunch?  Really?  We had to ask someone in charge to explain the bill to us.  He said that really each drink was two drinks, so we didn't have two drinks between us, but rather 4.  My rum and coke was $18 after the discount, and my girlfriend's virgin drink was $9 after the discount.  I am still confused even as I write this.  So my one drink costs about the same as an entire bottle of rum after the discount?  Rum and cokes are normally $36 apiece?  Really?  All in, our simple quick lunch by the beach ran us about $60.  A weak drink and a terrible sandwich for that money?  Craziness!  How do they add insult to injury?  Why with an 18 percent mandatory tip of course.  I have never felt so compelled to tell a restaurant to go and F**K off before!  This is absolutely the worst place I have ever been in the world!  I would have been happier if I ate at Subway and was mugged afterwards.  Seriously avoid!"

        "review": "I haven't had a lunch this bad for a really long time.  It was disgusting!  I ordered from Seamless Web and went with the Cheeseburger ($10.50) which came with a side of fries.  Simple enough order, right?  Let me count the ways they went wrong:1.  Sandwich arrived in a flat take-out container rather than a sandwich container.2.  Requested medium rare, but it was prepared medium/medium well.3.  Hamburger was not uniform in thickness, so it had weird bulges on one side that were charcoal-y and very burnt. 4.  Requested bleu cheese for my cheese, but I couldn't readily detect it.  I think they used bleu cheese dressing instead.  Gross.  Apparently $10.50, isn't enough money to cover a couple crumbles of the real thing.  5.  Sandwich was really soggy and oozing a creamy juice.  There was no way to prevent it from coating my fingers and stop the bun from falling apart.  Said ooze did not taste good either.   6.  The single pickle was a 1 inch thick coin that really didn't work on the sandwich.  At least cut it in half and distribute it.    7.  The crinkle cut fries were clearly pre-purchased in bulk and fried.  Think Ore-Ida.  Absolutely flavorless.  Gourmet spots like Burger Creations and BRGR have much better sandwiches at a lower price point.  Who would deal with this madness?  This is really one of the worst cheeseburgers I have ever had.  Ugh!"

        "review": "I just had lunch here today.  That was the most surreal dining experience I have had in quite some time.  We all know the soup nazi, but have you met the pasta fascist?  So this is primarily a to-go place.  But they have 4 2-tops set up for those wishing to dine in.  The rules are, eating-in allows you 1/2 table for 15 minutes.  There are no less than 3 custom-made signs chiding you to eat and leave quickly.  The precise wording for 2 of the signs is:  \"Eat fast! We need the table.  You choke, we do Heimlich\"\"Godot ain't comin'.  Pay.  Eat.  Bus your table.  Leave!\"Wow!  The guy at the counter was wearing a dress shirt, sweater vest, an Italian felt hat, reading an Italian newspaper, and was split between hollering and singing in Italian.  He was discussing with the cooks about fat Spanish lady who just called for a to-go order (in Italian).  Since everything is to-go and the dining in is kind of discouraged, service is nil.  The  menu.  Everything is written on a chalkboard above the main counter, but it is kind of smeared.  I had difficulty reading it.  The owner was kind enough to give me a take-out menu which was much more legible.  On the take-out menu they have this:\"NO DIET COKE, NO SKIM MILK, NO DECAF COFFEE OR TEA; ONLY GREAT FOOD\" -- ahem, great food is the customer's line, capisce?The food.  Complimentary basket containing 3 slices of bread.  Olive oil is self-serve from the main wall.  You can ladle some of the oil with spices onto a plate and take it to your table.  The oil is pretty cheap, and it's not extra virgin.  The spices aren't infused either; they just exist in the sauce.  So it really does nothing to the bread which was served at room temperature.  But it's complimentary, so okay.  For the entree I had the lasagna.  I was served a fairly large portion that was doused in a generous ladle full of bolognese sauce.  The noodles were flat (like in Italy) and very soft and pliant.  I want to say they were homemade.  The sauce was surprisingly bland, and I could only register the taste of the ground beef.  No ricotta cheese, or any other cheese for that matter could be found in the dish.  This was amazing.  How do you make lasagna without ricotta?  Well, yes I know you can use a Bechamel sauce, but that wasn't to be found either.  So what I have concluded is that the proprietor just cut out the most expensive ingredient of the dish, and hoped that adding some more ground beef will make everything alright.  Just a bland, terrible lasagna at a high enough price point that I certainly expected better.  My Coke was served in a plastic cup that had to have cost less than the can.  So, no, for all of the peculiarities of the owner and his insistence that you hurry, the food is definitely not worth the effort.  This was surprisingly bad even for a quick lunch where my expectations were low to begin with.  I strongly recommend Tre Giovanni which is not too far away, has much better authentic homemade Italian food at the same price point and a much larger seating area.  Trust me!"

Um, a starving Peace Corps volunteer would turn their nose up at this tripe.  This was my worst Seamless Web order ever.  The high end for the delivery estimate was 30 minutes.  That seemed kind of long for lunch given that I only ordered a panini and the place was a few minutes away.  After an hour, yes HOUR, I called the phone number for the restaurant.  I learned that the number was not valid for voice mail messages.  Are you serious??  So, I then called Seamless Web.  After being on the phone for a few minutes, my doorman called and informed me that delivery person finally made it.  I was handed my sandwich with nary an apology.I opened up the tiny takeout container (suitable for a side order), and saw the two halves of my sandwich squished inside.  Each half was noticeably charred black with grill marks and pressed very thin.  All I could taste was burnt.  If I could pick up anything in the background, it was way too much salt.  Yeah, burnt salt.  Yum.  God awful.  Just avoid."

        "review": "One of the worst lunches I ever had in my life.  How in the world do you mess up such a simple dish as linguine with clam sauce?  Well, first I guess you forgo the use of fresh clams.  Indeed, not a single clam shell was to be found in my dish.  Perhaps they scooped the meat out of the shells for my convenience?  No, not at all.  What little clam meat there was came chopped up into tiny chunks.  This was definitely clam sauce from a can; the kind you can find on a supermarket rack covered with dust with a sale price of $0.99.  And the sauce they apparently outsourced to said can.  It had a horrible aftertaste with a strong, abrupt flavor.  The plentiful linguine noodles were barely dressed in this sauce, so the whole dish tasted a lot like boiled noodles.  The cost for this dreary selection?  A whopping $18!  This has to be the highest markup I have seen in some time.  Absolutely horrible."

        "review": "A welcome, new addition to my Worst Restaurants in the U.S. list.  This gem hails all the way from Lake Placid -- a resort destination!  Perhaps we should have ordered the pizza, a safer option by most measures.  Instead, I was slightly more ambitious and ordered the lasagna.  Oh, what a dreadful plate this was.  My portion was noticeably squat and small.  My girlfriend immediately likened it to a Lean Cuisine.  If only!  Lean Cuisines actually taste better.  This lasagna just had the strangest aftertaste.  It was so distracting, that I had great difficulty in actually finishing my plate.  The meat was tasteless and boasted nothing in the way of texture.  The ricotta was more like thick curds.  The lasagna was topped with a ladle full of simple tomato sauce and garnished with chopped parsley.  The sauce was decidedly bad and the parsley made me think we had time warped to the 1970s.  The plate rang in at $14+ or about the price of 5 Lean Cuisines.  At least I could eat some of my food; my girlfriend could only stare at the monstrosity she was served.  Yikes.    The place itself is cavernous.  Like, it could be converted to an indoor hockey rink in the winter kind of cavernous.  The kitchen is on open view, and it is probably the largest kitchen I have ever seen.  During the low season, this seemed like a waste of space.  Given the quality of the food, I imagine it's a waste of space during the high season too.  The service was very slow with one girl working a handful of tables.  In short, there was nothing to recommend this place at all, hence the rating"

If I am in Union Station, I have precious little time to buy a last minute ticket, grab dinner, and hit the Acela first class lounge for the courtesy pre-boarding announcement for the train home.  Unfortunately, the real whammy in the whole commute is deciding where to eat at in Union Station.  The choices are pitifully bad.  Pasta T'Go-Go is no exception.  They specialize in generous heapings of pasta and a slather of weak sauces.  The bolognese sauce for example is little more than finely ground beef, tomato paste, and water.  If you opt for something more sophisticated than a bowl of penne noodles, you will be met with the sorriest looking lasagna you have ever seen.  Yeah, don't do it.  The combo special includes, beyond the pasta, a large portion of garlic bread and a soda.  My garlic bread was hard and rubbery with a modicum of flavor and tasted as good as that sounds.  Pass.  Just upgrade to first class where a good, free hot meal is available and avoid this nonsense."

        "review": "Dreadful.Wait, the inane setup or the food?The only difficulty for me was deciding which was worse.For the food, I opted for the Pitmaster dinner ($25) which included one quarter pound lean brisket, one pork spare rib, one beef rib, one quarter chicken, and two sides.  For the sides I had the chili and the mac and cheese.  The ribs were the absolute worst I encountered anywhere in my life -- unbelievably bad.  Whether it was the beef rib or the pork rib, it didn't matter as each bite only registered one flavor -- salt!  So salty.  Adding the house BBQ sauce failed to help much.  In the case of the beef rib, matters were worse.  Apparently it was undercooked, so biting into it proved to be quite messy.  Instead of lightly adhering meat cooked to perfection, my teeth were busy yanking the entire slab of meat from the bone at once.  I tried biting off a more manageable chunk to no avail.  The rib had been reduced to knife and fork fare.  Unbelievably, even then I had to saw away with vigor with my knife to yield a morsel of meat; by this point, I simply gave up.  Okay, so they are not a rib place.  Well, the chicken was pretty bad too.  There was absolutely no flavor whatsoever -- a vain death of a plump bird.  The brisket?  Passable, but nothing special.  Ditto for the chili.  The mac and cheese though was a regrettable mess.  I mean, penne pasta?  Really?  The pasta picked up a modicum of melted cheese, the variety of which I could not discern.  The presentation was preposterously messy and undesirable.  Even my sweet tea was bad.  How do you mess up sweet tea?The setup was especially irritating.  There was a line to give your name -- in other words, a line to wait in line.  This gave us an estimated 20 minute wait.  We opted later to just sit outside, which allowed us immediate entry.  This put us promptly at the end of another very long line to order meat.  After this line, we waited in line to order the sides, and again in another line to order drinks.  Everything was placed on one tray for the two of us.  I had to carry said tray to the checkout line to pay for the dinner before being allowed to eat outside.  The line was especially long and there was only one checkout person.  Curiously enough, I was the only person with a tray.  Weighing about 20 pounds with all of the food and drinks and no place to rest the tray, I quickly became antsy.  I really didn't think I would be able to hold it for 20 minutes without dropping it given all of the people passing by me or bumping into me.  So we just opted to sit at a table inside.  Now I was properly seated and had people bumping into my chair every few minutes.  One young female patron even looked at me rudely when she ran into my chair, as if somehow I jumped in her way being seated and all.    A classy establishment indeed.  Clearly a disaster in every way possible.  This place is only enjoyable for frat boys loading up on alcohol who have never been to a real BBQ place in their lives.  Everyone else should take heed and go elsewhere.  Avoid."

        "review": "We thought we would have one last Michelin starred meal before leaving for Australia.  Public was left on the narrowing list, so we made a reservation.  What a shame.  It was among the most disappointing meals I ever had. Ambience:  a converted warehouse which allows for poor circulation of the air conditioning making for a very warm dinner on a summer night.  It was also effective in maintaining a high noise level making it difficult to understand anything your girlfriend might be saying to you with her normal voice.  In a word, agitating.  Dress Code:  at the Michelin level, I never had to make note of how people dressed, until now.  I mean, typically men wear suits, sport coats, or at least a dress shirt.  At a minimum, some level of effort is made to look presentable to the general public.  Public takes a different approach.  This was perhaps best exemplified by the gentleman at the bar wearing a \"wifebeater\".  Classy.  Of course, one might argue that he was an anomaly.  But the men on either side of me wearing shorts and t-shirts made me feel woefully overdressed.  Maybe they were really wise though and anticipated a lack of air conditioning.  At any rate, this was the sort of place where bib pants would probably have been acceptable.  Service:  Folksy and scattered.  It felt like I was eating at an Applebee's in Omaha.  The water server chipping my glass, making it unusable, and leaving without saying a word was criminally neglectful though.  Food:  Surely this must be what they are good at, as there is no other reason to ever set foot in this place.  Well, again disappointment triumphs.  Ugh.  For the first course, I ordered the \"cured wild boar, garrotxa cheese, marinated olives, caper berries, and crostini\" ($12.50).  This really -- sounded -- delicious.  If only it were.  The presentation was unbelievable.  In a bad way.  The wild boar and cheese were sliced razor thin and coupled together.  While there may have been several slices of each, the total amount of protein on the plate was less than one ounce.  There were a few crostini randomly placed on the plate which were a little bit thicker.  To complete the effect, a few tasteless, cheap green olives were strewn about and a caper berry was never spotted.  Tasting notes included the words oily, salty, and oily.  Good lord.For the main course, I opted for the New Zealand venison loin with Cabrales dumplings, oyster mushrooms, and salsa verde ($28.50).  On the positive side, at least some effort was actually made in constructing this dish.  I imagined the chef behind this dish was more than a 8 year old with a pen knife.  The venison was okay though a bit chewy which grated on the jaw muscles after awhile.  Unfortunately the protein was buried under a hefty serving of a gloopy, green sauce and perched on Cabrales dumplings.  I am not exactly sure what a Cabrales dumpling is, but I think it is only a concoction a molecular gastronomist could come up with.  How else could one concentrate so much salt into such a small volume and raise the density of the food material to the level of tungsten?  In general, I make an effort to finish everything I am served, no matter how bad.  However, this was nearly impossible to finish.  The strange aftertaste and the ode to salt were simply too much.  I felt nauseous by the end of the meal.  Good grief.Overall, this is a terrible restaurant that has no business receiving any accolades.  I would have had a better meal at a chain restaurant because the food is always edible, there is no pretense, and the service standards are better.  Avoid.  Yeah, definitely stay clear of this mess."

Their menu boasts a large selection of traditional Jamaican fare.  The menu might be a bit more useful if it ranked its food by sodium content.  My 4-piece jerk chicken box was unbearably salty.  Beyond that, it was equally unbearably spicy.  As a point of reference, I beat the phaal challenge at Brick Lane Curry House, so I have credibility to complain when food is too spicy, something I have never done before until now.  Making matters even worse, the pieces of chicken were unsightly being a uniform shade of black.  Huh?  The black beans on the side were nearly as regrettable.  The food wasn't too expensive at all, but that does not take into account that I had to throw away no less than 3 of those 4 chicken pieces making what I actually ate pretty expensive for what I got.  Avoid like the plague."

Given the proximity to the ocean and the ease with which this comfort food can be prepared, this seemed like a sure bet.  Sure enough though, this choice was a most regrettable one.  What was presented to me was an unmitigated disaster.  The several apparent errors were all equally egregious.  First of note was that the chips were actually POTATO CHIPS and not fries as depicted on their very own sign.  If you are going to re-define a well known dish, you should provide the appropriate caveat to the customer.  Short of that, if you are going to make a major substitution, it should at least be for the better.  Alas.  These potato chips were unusually salty, and their flavor once adjusted for the high salt content, failed to add anything to the dish.  There were also not many chips, so this clearly was a cheap gesture.  Another cheap gesture was stacking the two filets on said chips on a tiny plastic salad plate and not offering trays.  One really needed to use both hands to carry this plate to a table and make sure nothing fell along the way.  I am sure someone looked at unit costs and determined that tiny disposable salad plates would be a money saver.  Additionally, cocktail sauce was not on view, but was available upon request only.  So far not so good, and we haven't even got to the fish yet.  Dreadful -- in a word.  I will allow that the color was nice and that it was not over fried.  But seriously, how do you fry fish so that it has NO TASTE whatsoever??  I would insert a forkful in my mouth, jostle it around my tongue, consider it, search for some nuance of flavor, shake my head effectively giving up, and swallow.  Repeating the process twenty times or so I ultimately finished this terrible meal.  While I labored and, well, suffered through this meal, you don't have to.  Please, just avoid this place.  The majority of their business is unsuspecting tourists who won't return to the wharf anytime again soon.  With all of their cost cutting measures, it is just easy money for them, and they have no incentive to change.  Amazing seafood can be found in Santa Barbara at a spectrum of price points.  There is really no reason to consume anything here.  And if you think my critique of the fish and chips was harsh, I can only imagine what my review would have been like for their number two bestseller, the clam chowder in a bread bowl.  The broth was brown -- yikes!Enough said."

        "review": "A case study in terrible food.  I went here yesterday for an unassuming lunch, and I left quite disappointed and slightly nauseous.I ordered the croquetas de jamon ($5 or $6) for an appetizer followed by the lechon asado con mojo (12$ or $13) for the entree.  The croquetas totalled 5 in number and were deep fried a little too long as evidenced by its dark breaded skin.  The interior was a mushy jumble of sandwich grade ham that was distinctly flavorless.  The accompanying dipping sauce was a tall cup of ketchup, no joke.  A disappointing start to be sure, but I assumed the entree would be considerably better.  I mean how can you mess up suckling pig, yucca, and black beans with rice?  These are solid ingredients that make for a filling meal with little fuss, right?  Rest assured, this dish was even worse.  If you look at my attached photo you will see the pool of oil collected in the lower righthand corner of the photo.  The photo is misleading however, as the entire plate had was covered in a pool of oil.  The oil was not high quality either, so there was nothing to gain from this saturation.  The pork and the yucca were overstuffed with garlic to the point that it was comical.  I could even taste garlic in the rice, but I wasn't sure if that was my mouth being overwhelmed by the garlic in the other two offerings, or if the chef really felt that the rice needed garlic too.  So, yucca that could not be tasted at all due to oil and garlic; pork that tasted like garlic; and rice and beans that were bland and soulless.  Failure in every direction.The service was especially slow, and in the very small space there was little to do except read the rave reviews posted on the wall (all from 2007) and listen to one Juanes song after the other.  We covered at least one album worth of his music during my ill fated venture here.  When the bill came, I was surprised to see that my two choices were each $1 more than the prices listed on the menu, hence the range shown above.  I thought about disputing this, but then I did a cost benefit analysis.  Is it worth it to save $2 if I have to spend 10 more minutes in this place trying to get the waiter's attention?  No.  No it's not.  Off I went, with the intent to never return.  Terrible.  Some last thoughts.  The portion sizes were very generous.  This is often the case with really bad food.  The chef tries to make up for lack of quality, by increasing quantity.  And, Cubans of the city should rise and protest this place.   Seriously, this is outrageous."

And they were not sweet onions.-  Noodles that were very starchy and failed to separate easily.-  Broth that had the distinct taste of hot water  (pre Sriracha)-  Sparing incorporation of gristly beef-  Limp basil and not particularly flavorful bean sprouts-  An aromaless mess that was less than the sum of its parts.Worse, the place is quite Americanized with its playing of club music and its use of flat screen TVs giving tutorials on how to eat pho -- is it really that complicated?  With that said though, the Asian/Caucasian ratio was a very high 14:3 which was probably what misled me into walking into this place in the first place.  The staff was pleasant, but really my meal was terrible, and I just wanted to leave.  Maybe the shabu is better, but, please, for the love of God, stay away from their pho."

        "review": "There is an old saying, \"Don't cast your pearls before swine.\"  Allow me to update it:  \"Don't waste your money at the Spotted Pig.\"On the occasion of my 400th review, I am going to highlight the worst Michelin-starred restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  I arrived alone early on a week night, and the hostess explained that if I wanted a table, the wait would be over an hour, but I could just eat at the bar, and she recommended the bar upstairs since it would be a bit quieter.   Said bar had 9 seats with all of them occupied.  Unfortunately there was very little area to stand.  All of the tables were taken, and people were clamoring around with their drinks.  Food runners were passing by me about every minute or so.  I constantly had to keep moving to one side or another.  20 minutes passed.  At this point, I decided to just stick it out.  I figured someone would finish their drinks and I could finally take a place at the bar, but that was not going to happen anytime soon.  Other people started to arrive, and were deciding whether to wait it out too.   Most left, but after 50 minutes, a group of 3 came and decided to wait.  I am pretty certain they wanted to jump in front of me since three of the people were getting ready to leave, but my patience was exhausted and I wasn't about to allow it.  I finally got a seat after 63 minutes.  I should have just put my name on the list.  Observation #1:  Michelin starred restaurants normally take reservations, for good reason.  Observation #2:  For a Michelin-starred restaurant, this place is unique since the majority of the business was focused on drinking beer, with no less than 3 bars in the place.  Time to eat.  The newly seated group was given their menu first and ordered first.  I then had to ask for a menu for myself.  The place is very popular for their hamburger and fries, which does not sound like a very difficult dish to prepare culinarily.  I opted for something more interesting, the crispy pork belly served with bean puree and a small selection of greens.   To drink, I had their house specialty, the Spotted Pig bitter.  The beer was very light, but otherwise was okay.  The pork belly was just terrible.  Fried, greasy, lacking in flavor.  How could something so naturally delicious be transformed into a heavy mound of blandness?  It was so bad, I actually had to force myself to finish it.  Keep in mind that pork belly is the savory equivalent of ice cream, and like ice cream no one ever has trouble finishing it.  Not to be outdone, the greens were worse.  I couldn't identify what they were.  I also couldn't identify the antiseptic aftertaste they left in my mouth.  Was that bleach?  Honestly, I am asking.  Now the bean puree was tasty.  Unfortunately it is almost a cliche now to serve a pureed accompaniment next to a major protein -- a staid choice to be sure.  And the presentation was just boring.  It was the sort of dinner I would expect to have at a place like Applebee's.  Ambience.  The patrons and staff were consistently interesting but I say that ironically.  One of the gentlemen sitting at the bar offered me his hamburger and fries since he didn't want it.  I refused.  Then one of the servers dropped a tray of glasses at the bar which resulted in flying shards of glass departing in nearly every direction.  Another gentlemen sitting right next to me leaned in to get my attention, and warned me that one of the shards hit him and that I should be careful that there wasn't any broken glass that may have landed in my food.  Have I mentioned that this was a Michelin-starred restaurant?  Then one one of the patrons was finishing a night of standing up and drinking and decided to lean in over me while I was eating to pay her bill.  This culminated with her actually throwing the pen she used to sign the bill right over my shoulder, hitting me in the process.  Indeed, this was a very classy establishment.  The entire time it was so loud and distracting, a moment of culinary pleasure in a charming restaurant was just not going to be had here.  I was asked by the bartender how I liked everything.  I responded that I didn't like my dinner at all.  She said I should have said something sooner so that they could have taken the dish off of my bill.  She was very nice about it.  But I wasn't looking for a free meal, I was interested in evaluating their food.  And in my opinion, you have exactly one chance to get it right.  She did take the drink off of my bill which was a nice gesture.     Overall, this venue is just a popular bar that serves a supposedly decent hamburger.  If you want to eat anything else or you think that this place is in anyway more special than that due to all of the accolades it has received, you will be sorely disappointed.  But this is why Yelp is useful.  I can tell you about my very bad experience so that you will know better and not be taken in by the hype."

I began with the mussel soup and had the rabbit ragout with fresh pappardelle for the entree.  I was really looking forward to the mussel soup given how cold it was that night.  And yet, it was the worst mussel soup I ever had.  Seriously, how do you mess this dish up?  I make it at home with wine and saffron and it's fantastic.  Here it tasted like they poured Campell's tomato soup over the mussels.  Any taste of the sea was gone -- sacrilege!  And the rabbit ragout?  It reminded me of pulled pork, only really bland.  That animal truly died in vain.  Their wine selection is very nice, but only if you are buying by the bottle.  My glass of wine consisted of what was left in 2 of their bottles.  That was $10 well spent.  For the same money, I could have had an incredible meal at Lupa -- I should have braved the cold for the longer walk.  Never  again!"

        "review": "I valiantly ate about a third of my Seamless Web lunch from Stir Cafe, but I simply had to throw the rest of it in the garbage.  Being a former Peace Corps volunteer, I can say that this is not something I would ever do readily with food -- it really was just that bad.  I ordered the \"Chicken Parmesan Served over Baked Ziti\" ($8.95).  I was surprised at how much it weighed, comparable to the weight of my laptop.  The densely packed meal was seemingly a bargain, but it wasn't to be.  The sauce was not a traditional marinara, but rather a cross between a marinara and a cream sauce.  It resembled a vodka cream sauce, but it really didn't taste like that.  Indeed, it had an awkward aftertaste that was not pleasant in the least.  Rather than sparingly use this questionable sauce, they decided to douse the chicken plank in it.   At least the chicken wasn't dry as a result, but who wants to eat soggy chicken with a weird aftertaste?  Not me.  Giving up pretty quickly on the chicken, I thought  I would just eat the noodles.  Being a baked ziti, I was looking for a lot of texture and baked in flavor from the sauce.  Instead I got rubbery noodles glazed in said sauce.  I couldn't win with this dish.  The only thing that was passable was the accompanying piece of bread.  Final pronouncement:  Avoid even if really hungry."

The steamed buns were almost gelatinous and very chewy.  As there was not much filling, this ended up being a bland mess.  The curry was a little watery and the blend of spices was insufficiently complex -- a real whimper.  The server was neither particularly friendly nor did he have much to say.  Once I signed my credit slip, about 1/2 second passed before he grabbed the slip from my hands.  Wow, that was the  only thing that was fast in this restaurant.

        "review": "If you are hungry for Lebanese food, I can't think of a more disappointing place to go.  This is highlighted by the fact that if you look over the brunch menu and the regular menu, you will find very few Middle Eastern selections.  In fact, much of the menu reads like diner fare.For lunch I had the Middle Eastern combination platter which included felafel, hummus, Baba ghanoush, Israeli salad, one stuffed grape leave, feta cheese, olives, and a peperoncini.  The felafel was over fried which led to a crispy outer shell and a center of little flavor.  The hummus was not particularly good, and the choice of olive oil failed to enhance it in anyway.  The Baba ghanoush just tasted like a random dip with no flavor of the eggplant coming through.  The accompanying pita was very dry and was quite bad.  The Israeli salad was decent, and everything else was acceptable.   All in all though, presentation aside, it was a disaster on a plate.  Beyond the unappealing food, I was completely lost in understanding what this restaurant was about.  I mean, they specialize in Middle Eastern food, but most of their selections are American.  They have a comedy cellar on site, and they show Charlie Chaplin movies on their wall.  Perhaps the connection is that you can't have comedy (the club) without tragedy (the food)."

Additionally, I ordered an appetizer of summer rolls ($4.25) on the side.  The summer rolls were almost entirely filled with lettuce and some carrots.   Of the 4 rolls served, I only managed to eat one due to the poor quality, ignoring the other 3 all together.  I did detect a single shrimp in it, but really these rolls were just terrible.  Wrapped salad is how they should be labeled on the menu.  The penang curry was also disappointing.  There were about 5 pieces of beef, an amazing amount of onions, plenty of green beans, and some bamboo shoots in a spicy coconut milk sauce.  The sauce was a bit thick and clunky.  Also too much coconut milk was used since the heat was only the barest hint of spice.  I prefer a much more aggressive curry than this.  The over emphasis on inexpensive ingredients really made this dish suffer.The decor is actually not so bad.  But I thought it was odd that the entire time I was having lunch in this very spacious restaurant, I was the ONLY person in the restaurant.  This was at peak time!I would say this is the worst Thai food I ever had in NYC, but then I walked past Galanga on the way back to the office.  So, yes, you can do marginally worse."

But my real issue is with the fish and chips.  From the photo which I have uploaded, you can clearly see that it was over fried.  Rather than layers of flavor, there was just layers of grease.  Any taste of the fish itself was not only muted, but entirely overcome by the taste of inexpensive oil.  Unfortunately, this extended to the fries as well since they must have been fried in the same oil.  A disaster.  The provided tartar sauce was not good at all.  I asked for cocktail sauce, and the waitress looked at the other waitress and gave her a look like I was nuts.  She checked in the back, and came out to say that the chef was on break and that they never have cocktail sauce available at the restaurant.  I can only imagine the confusion if I asked for some remoulade.  I confirmed, \"really, never?\".  \"Never,\" she responded.  And \"never\" again will I go back here."

        "review": "Home briefly for the holidays, my mom wanted me to treat her dinner.  Her first choice, a very popular restaurant in Mt. Pleasant, was closed for a private event, so we ended up crossing the street and coming here.  This didn't seem like a bad idea at the time since I remember seeing Goo's on the corner ever since I was a kid.  Their longevity should be a testament to their quality food, right?  Boy did we get this one wrong.  Seating is set up in L-shape, so one can choose from booths all along the right wall or head left into an alcove area where there are 3 tables.  We opted for one of the free booths, but the waitress came over with some other patrons and explained that they wanted to move from their booth to the one we chose, but we were welcome to their booth.  We made the change and within a few minutes quickly found out why the other people moved.  Apparently a family was seated behind that booth and their children couldn't restrain from slapping the table, kicking the seats, rocking, yelling out loud, etc.  It was only worse that the parents or other family members actively encouraged this behavior.  So we moved once again to that alcove area which was also an unfortunate choice given how cold it was there.  Being next to the street and the main door, there could not have been any insulation because we noticed the drop in temperature.  Service was very scattered.  While we saw the waitress when we came in, I am not sure if we ever saw her again the rest of the night.  Instead, we had a couple of guys from the bar coming by once in awhile and asking if we needed anything.  They looked clearly put out and yet it did not seem like there were many people here at all.  Very strange.The food was disastrous.  I mean, I thought I chose the safest item on the menu, the lasagna.  My mom opted instead for the wine marinated steak tips.  These are fairly quick orders to prepare, but we ended up waiting more than a half hour to receive them.  Inexplicably slow service.  My lasagna was the worst I have ever had in my life, and it is so remarkable because all of the different mistakes they made in preparing it.  If you tried to make a bad lasagna, it would not have been as bad this one was.  It was served as a large narrow rectangle that was less one inch thick.  The photo is attached; have you ever seen a lasagna this thin?  It was a single layer.  It was noticeably burnt on the edges.  The texture of the pasta noodle varied considerably over its length.  Near the edges it was sometimes rubbery, sometimes crispy, and inwards it was sometimes chewy and otherwise unremarkable.  I am puzzled at how they created so many textures in one sample.  The ricotta was a tough monolithic curd of cheese.  The marinara sauce was only added after the lasagna was reheated and was not part of the original dish.  The sauce itself was heavily flavored with inexpensive Parmesan cheese.  Not enjoyable at all, and every mistake that could be made was made in preparing this dish.  Awful.  The marinated steak tips were considerably better by comparison (I sampled these), but even then, they were just passable.  The meat was noticeably chewy (overcooked and under-marinated).  The saving grace was that the drinks were cheap.  Like two glasses of wine and a bottle of beer for $9 cheap.  The ambience was nonexistent.  I mean even discounting for the random loud family, there was nothing interesting about this place.  No background music at all, so the restaurant was much louder than it needed to be.  The walls were sparsely adorned with advertisements for American beers and nothing else.  There was really nothing to fixate the eyes upon.  A dreadful choice.  Next time I am going to choose the restaurant.  My mom might not like \"fancy\" places, but at least the food is always edible.  Oh, one final warning, this place is CASH ONLY.  Seriously avoid."

        "review": "Shades was my most infamous review.  It is the only restaurant I reviewed where the owner prayed for my soul on judgment day!! (no joke).  My review set off a debate from coast to coast.  People from Seattle and New York alike weighed in with their thoughts on Shades and their dubious owners.  The string of fake reviews by the owners and their friends were a source of so many laughs -- who can forget the request for a sandwich with \"white toes\"?  (Apparently the owners of Shades were offering free sandwiches to customers who would write favorable reviews of the restaurant and toes was a misspelling of toast I can only presume).  With all of the backlash I received for my initial review, the clear assumption was that I was wrong in my diagnosis.  I didn't know anything about food.  The food was amazing, and I simply failed to recognize this.  Well, what do you know?  This restaurant is now out of business -- only a few months after my initial review.  My review almost certainly has nothing to do with their ultimate demise, but it is surely symptomatic.  Instead of fighting me so hard, and proving me \"wrong\", a much better approach would have been to address my concerns and strive to offer better food.  But hubris, pride, being stubborn, fell in the way of all this.  Too bad.  I never had ill will against Shades, but I was certainly taken aback by their very strong reaction to my review.  So it goes.  Rest in peace Shades."

        "review": "A regrettable dining choice.  This is apparently a buffet-style/hybrid restaurant specializing in American food that brags about having the best breakfast around.  But as my luck would have it, I actually went there for dinner.  Here are some telling observations that I feel best summarizes the experience:-  Seated at the booth, I could distinctly feel the springs pressing into my buttocks.-  When walking to the salad/vegetable/dessert bar, I could feel my feet sticking to the floor and heard the squeaks confirming the traction.  -  There were mystery items available which would have been best remaining mysteries.-  The salmon I ordered was very small, very dry, quite old, and absolutely the wrong color.-  The pudding at the dessert bar had a weird taste that I absolutely could not identify.  Something from high school chem lab, perhaps.  -  Prices were amazingly low for entrees.-  Service was friendly, and I was asked how I liked everything.  But I had no idea where to begin, so I just shrugged my shoulders.If you want to save money, prefer food in great quantity, and are not a fan of flavor or quality when it comes to food, this place is for you.  Everyone else should take heed."

        "review": "On travel and was intrigued by the sample menu for this chain restaurant.  I liked the idea of burritos inspired by foreign cuisine.  I had the Thai burrito with \"prawns\" for lunch.  It quickly fell apart and needed to be eaten with a fork.  The prawns were actually 5 medium shrimp, and the combination of ingredients and taste were faintly Thai.  This was the furthest thing from \"Pam's Real Thai\" in New York.  I should have known to stay away from a restaurant that uses \"gourmet\" in its title.  Terrible food."

        "review": "I saw their awning advertising cookies, ice cream, and shakes and decided to stop in for a shake to beat the heat.  I was able to choose from among all of their regular ice cream selections so I opted for the Rocky Road.  There seemed to be some confusion on the part of the two employees on how to make a milk shake and just how much milk should be added.  The end result was what only could be described as a literal interpretation of a milkshake.  It had the liquid consistency and taste of milk with a hint of some sort of sweet flavor and the occasional ground nut coming through the straw.  Absolutely disgusting -- worst milkshake I ever had in my life!"

        "review": "A glorified food court that attaches an unwitting celebrity chef's name to it in order to command a 30% premium over fair market prices.  My ham and provolone sandwich was just a stack of lunch meat capped with a leaf of lettuce, Vidalia onions, and a mayonnaise-based sauce all contained between either end of a wheat bun.  Hardly an original concept, and hardly gourmet in preparation.  I was expecting something like Tom Colicchio's 'wichcraft, but instead I found something midway between Subway and Quizno's.  Terrible."

Their bold advertising of Asian flavors had me nonplussed.  After all, Asia is a large continent with many different types of cuisine and flavors.  Would these wings taste like rogan josh?  like miso?  like bibambap?  Being an American chain of course, I was sure to be disappointed.  I just wasn't sure by how much.  Apparently Asian flavors amounted to taking already prepared chicken wings, running them through a simple syrup with flavorless red chilies, and shaking the container so that the chicken is evenly coated.  Because the coating was even, they sucked uniformly.  The final blow: it was served with a fork.  Good god, what was I thinking?  This should cover my fast food fix for another year or so..."
